# Chesa-Website
 
As part of a collaborative project, I contributed to the development of a simple website for the Chemical Engineering Student Association (CHESA). 
This project involved teamwork, web design, and front-end development, aimed at providing a digital platform to enhance communication and engagement within the association.
